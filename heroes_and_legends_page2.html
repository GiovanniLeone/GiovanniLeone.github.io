          <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
          <p>Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was more of a flawed hero. He was considered
            very difficult to work with because of his intense desire for perfection. Nevertheless,
            he was still admired and loved by people who believed that being a part of Apple
            was special. Steve Jobs was a hero to the people who transformed their lives with
            Apple's products and by the people who worked for him. When Steve Jobs passed away,
            it was like the passing of a popular political leader to his customers.</p>
